Apple Black Rot,"Dark, sunken lesions on leaves and fruit; fruit shows concentric rings and may rot entirely.",Caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa, spread through wind and rain.,"Use resistant varieties, prune infected limbs, and avoid overhead watering.",Apply fungicides like captan or thiophanate-methyl
Apple Healthy,"Shiny green leaves, no signs of lesions or spots, and healthy fruit development.","Proper care, no disease presence, and suitable environmental conditions.","Continue good agricultural practices, regular monitoring, and balanced fertilization.",No treatment needed.,Maintain hygiene and monitor for any disease symptoms periodically.

Corn Common Rust,Reddish-brown pustules on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.,Caused by Puccinia sorghi, spread through airborne spores.,Grow resistant hybrids and maintain field sanitation.,Apply fungicides like azoxystrobin when infection level is high.
Potato Healthy,"Dark green, healthy leaves with firm tubers and no visible lesions.",Proper crop management and disease-free conditions.,Continue integrated pest management and regular monitoring.,None needed.,Maintain crop hygiene and rotate with non-solanaceous crops.
Potato Early Blight,"Dark, concentric ring lesions on lower leaves, yellowing, and leaf drop.","Caused by Alternaria solani; thrives in warm, humid weather.","Crop rotation, mulching, and resistant varieties help prevent.",Fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb can manage outbreaks.,Apply fungicides early and remove infected debris from fields.
